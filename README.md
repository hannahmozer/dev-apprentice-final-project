# Final Project - Dev Apprentice

Hello World! 

My Final Project I called "Dev Apprentice" is a React Js Web Application and I used VS Code to build it. 
I used GitHub to save my repository and finally I deployed my app using Vercel.

I've decided to build this virtual catalog, because like many beginners, in the very first beginning I'd had no idea how to start
and what are the contents covered and the careers that exist in this technological world. I separeted the content by area.

The first topic is "How to Start", it's a beginners life saving. Another topics separted by area are:
Web development, Data Science, Cyber Security, Software Engineering and Artificial Inteligence.

I hope that virtual catalog helps another people and bring light to their minds!

Best Regards,
Hannah Mozer.
